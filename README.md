# Cursor-Movement-using-Hand-detection-ComputerVision
In this project, a camera captures your video and depending on your hand gestures, you can  move the cursor and perform left click, right click, drag, select, and scroll up and down. The  predefined gestures make use of your hand gestures to mark different actions on mouse.

Well, the proposed project puts forward a hand gesture based system that allows user to  control the pc mouse movements through the use of hand movements. Our system uses pc webcam in order to detect hand gesture movements. The system continuously scans the camera input for finger hand like patterns. Once a hand is detected, the system then locks it as an objects. A flag is set on the object in order to mark it as an object. After the object has been flagged and detected, our system then constantly records its movements in terms of X y direction movement based coordinates. These coordinates are then mapped real time onto the mouse cursor to move it according to hand movements. Hand Tracking is done using mediapipe which draws 21 landmarks on the fingers .It uses autopy module which helps in movement of cursor.
